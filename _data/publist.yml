  image: hatebert.png
  description: We introduce HateBERT, a re-trained BERT model for abusive language detection inEnglish. The model was trained on RAL-E, a large-scale dataset of Reddit comments in Englishfrom communities banned for being offensive, abusive, or hateful that we have collected andmade available to the public. Results and trained models are published on <a href='https://osf.io/tbd58/?view_only=d90e681c672a494bb555de99fc7ae780'><b>an OSF repository</b></a>.

  description: In this contribution, we investigate a recent dataset for offensive language in English, namely OLID/OffensEval (Zampieri et al. 2019a; Zampieri et al. 2019b), in the light of two factors proposed by Waseem et al. 2017.

- title: "Modeling Legal Terminology in SUMO"
  image: legalsumo.png
  description: We discuss ontological modeling of legal terminology in formal ontologies, such is SUMO (Pease, 2001) and the possibility of utilizing its close connection to the lexical-semantic network WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) in the legal domain. Formal systems that allow for automated semantic interpretation of law supported by lexical resources can bring forth solutions to legal reasoning tasks.

  image: rhetorical.png
  description: This paper surveys ontological modeling of rhetorical concepts, developed for use in argument mining and other applications of computational rhetoric, projecting their future directions. We include ontological models of argument schemes applying Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST); the RhetFig proposal for modeling; the related RetFig Ontology of Rhetorical Figures for Serbian (developed by two of the authors); and the Lassoing Rhetoric project (developed by another of the authors).

  image: nlpUp.png
  description: This paper presents our submission for the SemEval shared task 6, sub-task A on the identification of offensive language. Our proposed model, C-BiGRU, combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We utilize word2vec to capture the semantic similarities between words. This composition allows us to extract long term dependencies in tweets and distinguish between offensive and non-offensive tweets.

  image: biasinducing.png
  description: We present a prototypical yet robust anddiverse data set for media bias research. It consists of 1,700 statements representing variousmedia bias instances and contains labels for media bias identification on the word and sentencelevel. In contrast to existing research, our data incorporate background information on theparticipants’ demographics, political ideology, and their opinion about media in general.
