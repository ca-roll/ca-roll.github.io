## How to add news
Go to /index. html to add a short description of the news. Delete the oldest news: There should always be 5 news displayed.
Then go to /news.html and add an (extended) description of the news here.

## How to add publications
Go to /publications/index.html and add a publication. You either link the paper via a link from the Internet, or you upload the paper pdf to /downloads and link from there. Add an image from the paper in the folder /images and link to it in the publication's index. If you delete a publication from the box view, do not forget to append it on the bottom to the list view.
